              The Great Dictator's Speech by Charlie Chaplin
            </div>
            <div class="des6">
              I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my
              business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to
              help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We
              all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want
              to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We
              don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is
              room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for
              everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have
              lost the way. <br />
              <br />Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world
              with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have
              developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that
              gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us
              cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and
              feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than
              cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these
              qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.... <br />
              <br />
              The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The
              very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men
              - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all.
              Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world -
              millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims
              of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.
              <br />
              <br />
              To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that
              is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men
              who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and
              dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return
              to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

              Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you -
              enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what
              to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you
              like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to
              these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine
              hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You
              have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the
              unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t
              fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! <br />
              <br />In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom
              of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all
              men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create
              machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the
              power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a
              wonderful adventure. <br />
              <br />Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power -
              let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world
              that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a
              future and old age a security. By the promise of these things,
              brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that
              promise. They never will! <br />
              <br />Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now
              let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the
              world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed,
              with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a
              world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness.
              Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
