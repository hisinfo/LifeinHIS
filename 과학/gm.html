              Abstract Part 1 - The Burner
              <br />
              The experiment's objective or the whole point was to understand
              and know how a burner works. The method we used was lighting an
              evaporating dish with different flame colours. Any simple
              experiment using a burner and changing the colour of the flame
              would work. Not everyone will be able to try to change because of
              the limitations of the materials(burner) so only the person who
              tried will know how to use a burner. The evaporating dish turned
              black(there was ash in the atmosphere) when it was heated by a
              blue flame(loose valve). When we took that black evaporating dish
              and heated it with a yellow flame(Tight valve) it became normal
              again.
              <br /><br />
              Part 2 - Holding Solids + The Balance
              <br />
              The objective of the experiment was to understand and know how to
              use a balance, centigram and to be able to move chemicals place to
              place just the amount that is necessary. The experiment we did was
              measured exactly 1.3 grams of sodium. As it was an experiment to
              know how a balance works and to be used to the materials that are
              used in the lab any experiment that includes using a balance will
              work.
              <br /><br />
              Part 3 - Measuring Liquids
              <br />
              The objective of this experiment was to be able to use and know a
              pipet, buret clamp and other materials that we have never used
              before. We filled water inside the pipet and loosened the bulb to
              release the water, and our goal was to find out how much water was
              out. We subtracted the current bulb from the previous measurement
              when it was filled.
              <br /><br />
              Just wanna add… All the experiments were done to be used and able
              to use the lab materials as many of us weren’t. It was also to be
              aware of the safety rules that we should always be aware of inside
              the lab. All the experiments were hard for everyone to participate
              in since there were limitations in the materials.
