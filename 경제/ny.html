            <div class="name1">Who Owns The Land? Essay</div>
            <div class="des1">
              Before Israel fell to Assyria in 720 B.C., Jews lived there for
              around 3,300 years, in 620 B.C. Assyria fell to Babylon, in 539
              B.C. Babylon fell to Persia, in 334 B.C. Persia to
              Greece(Alexander the Great) and Greece fell to Rome. As these
              historical events occurred Jews had spread all around the Earth
              without a Nation of their own. 2 thousand years later, in 1948,
              Jews across the Globe decided to form Israel again on the land
              their ancestors used to live in and claimed the right and
              ownership of the land. However, the people of Palestine have
              refused Israel and claimed their rights as they just took over the
              unused land and have used it for the past 1000 years. So Israel
              claims that the land belongs to them since old times and has
              biblical meanings. On the other hand, Palestine has used the land
              for the past 1000 years without anything having to bother them but
              suddenly Israel is claiming the right to its land. During WW1 the
              League of Nations awarded Britain an international mandate to
              administer Palestine during the post-war deal-making that redrew
              the map of the Middle East. The irony was Britain promised both
              Israel and Palestine ownership of the land to earn support from
              both nations but later gave the land to Israel as they found the
              relationship between Jews was much more valuable. This event made
              the conflict even more complicated. <br /><br />
              Looking at it in an Ethical way and international way, I believe
              Palestine has the ownership of the land as over the past 1000
              years no one has ever made ownership of that land. As numerous
              historical events occurred many nations lost and conquered lands
              and most countries don’t complain about the land they lost 1000 or
              more years ago. The Gwanggaeto Stele(광개토대왕릉비) is currently
              in China but South Korea owned that land around 1500 years ago,
              Mongolia was so much bigger, and other countries have their own
              problems and lost land or items. We can’t just give back all those
              land to those who originally owned the land since we can’t choose
              from when each nation owned that land. Such an opinion is very
              dangerous and could result in side effects like “Israel did it,
              why can’t we do it” and cause numerous international problems.

              Nevertheless, I believe that if Israel owns the land they will
              have better control and wealth over Palestine which means they can
              make improvements in science and technology as well as financial
              problems. Jews are not only the world's richest people but also
              one of the most intelligent people. They make up 2% of the U.S.
              population, 21% of the Ivy League students, 54% of the world chess
              champions, and 67% of the Forbes 400. As researches show Israel
              owning and controlling the land will give more wealth and
              stabilized economy. Israelites also empathize education which
              means the young will receive a higher level of education and
              overall quality of life. I also disagree with the religious and
              cultural mindset of Palestine as they follow the Islamic mindset
              of the middle east where children and women are abused and
              tolerated. Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and the Gaza
              Strip also heavily restrict freedom of expression, association,
              and assembly.

              <br /><br />
              Although, both nations own various reasons for their ownership of
              the land I strongly believe that no war can be justified in any
              circumstances as it creates refugees, economic and financial
              problems, violations of human rights, and most importantly loss of
              life. My belief is that negotiation and cooperation between Israel
              and Palestine is the only solution to this conflict. I do
              understand that having to share the land with another nation is
              almost impossible but since both nations claim strong ownership of
              the land of own and will not step back the only way is the
              coexistence of both nations of the land.

            <div class="name2">To live Movie Summary</div>
            <div class="des3">
              In the movie “To Live”, various events regarding the history of
              China were displayed. In the beginning of the movie the Chinese
              civil war is displayed. There is a scene where Fugui, the main
              character, is forced to join the KMT and participates in the war
              between the CCP(Communist Party) and the KMT(Nationalist Party).
              One morning when Pugui and his companions woke up they were left
              and the other soldiers ran away or were injured and died due to
              the cold overnight. Pugui decides to surrender to the CCP since he
              was told that CCPs treated their refugees with care and that they
              also gave them money to go back home.
              <br /><br />
              Pugui was born in a named family that was rich and famous but he
              was addicted to gambling so he lost all his money and the huge
              house that it was passed on from generation to generation.
              However, in the future after the China Communist Party had won the
              war, the owner of pugui’s previous house rejected and refused the
              communist party’s policy where everyone had equal property and was
              sentenced to death. Also this was when the Red Guards were
              introduced which shows the cultural revolution of China. Third
              event is when people gather all their steel to make weapons for
              the communist party to fight Taiwan where the rest of the
              nationalist party stands. People in the village bring all kinds of
              metal from bicycles, pans, and more to show their dedication
              towards the communist party.
              <br /><br />The communist system is shown in the movie where
              everyone gets food from the village restaurant and also a hard
              work equals reward system as the village gets meat dumplings for
              the steal they had collected. As to their dedication and awareness
              towards the community party, Pugui sends his son to school
              although his son had not had enough sleep because a high class was
              coming to the school. During the day Pugui’s son dies due to an
              accident and I think this scene showed how much people were afraid
              and yet somewhat tried to brown nose them. Pugui also had this
              authorized paper that proved that they were a part of the
              communist community and had it on this wall. He also had Mao’s
              drawings and books in his house.
